# HTMLTagsReader
This was created for CS2263 Introduction to C class. 
This is a C based application that that analyses an HTML file and prints of the list of all the unique HTML tags names (i.e. each tag printed once, no duplicates).
To identify the HTML tags use the following simplified definition of the tag names: The tag name starts immediately after the ‘<’ character, and consists of one or more non blank characters other than ‘/’ and is terminated by either the space character or by the ‘>’ character.
